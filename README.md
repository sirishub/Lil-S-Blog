            <h4><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! My Name is Siri, and I am a 10 year old girl. I love coding, and with my skills, I thout I could my my own blog! This is very cool, and I got the idea when my friend Shailaja suggested that I could make a website that is relevent to my interests. I can be random sometimes, so it's really hard to decide what I like doing most. Then, I got an idea to start my on blog. That way, I can post about anything I want that's about me! I'd like to thank Shailaja for giving this idea. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;My interests can vary, as I said, but here are just a few common ones of mine: creating art (origami & drawing specifically), reading books, coding (obviously!), and playing with my little sister! Yes, I do have a sister. Her name is Krithika (Krithi for short) and she is very cute! </h4>
